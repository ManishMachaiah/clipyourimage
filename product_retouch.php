                    <p>A product can have a basic retouch with some efforts that increase the stiffness of attraction. These kinds of retouches can be done quickly with lesser effort when compared with other types of product retouches. The features of the product can be made visible more precisely that people can either imagine a product before buying the same. Editing a photo doesn’t get bounded with the creation of artificial effects that won’t exist, but also an art of giving the experience effectively in the virtual world.</p>

These kinds of edits are premium-level edit that swallows a larger effort. We analyze each part, parameter, and effect that must be applied to edit the image. By this, we also gather the knowledge of what the images are demanding in the form of edit including brightness, sharpness, white-balance, saturation, what background can suit to the image based on the theme color of the product.</p>
